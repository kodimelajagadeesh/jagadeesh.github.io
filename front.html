    <h1>front end</h1>
    <h3>html</h3>
    <p>Front-end technologies provide the goal of attracting any type of software infrastructure. Back-end technologies might give smooth interaction with data, but if the view of the application or website does not attract users would hardly look twice at any websites, if there is no visual attraction to draw them in.  

        As per the research, within the next decade i.e., from 2019 to 2029, the growth for front-end developers is going to be huge in numbers. Keeping this in mind, one should pay attention to the front end technologies list in Java and front end technologies list in .net as well as the common front end web technologies list that can add success to one’s life in the software field. Some of the Best Front End Development Course can be found in the attached link. Also, here you will find the front end technologies list to watch out, these are the best front end technologies</p>

        <h3>css</h3>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
            
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
            
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
            
            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
            
            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>
    <h3>react js</h3>
    <p>If you are new to web technologies like React.js, you might have come with the thought that, why React is known as popular front end frameworks, why everyone should use it. You are in the correct place to clear up all your doubts. 

        React is known as a remarkably flexible library. Once you understand the concepts of react, you can use it on a vast variety of application platforms to build the great quality of user interfaces. React is known as Library it is not a framework. 
        React provides great developer experience. ReactJS APIs are easy to understand. React uses HTML inside JavaScript which is known as JSX. Here you can play with HTML as well as JavaScript.  
        React has Facebook’s support, as it is widely used in Facebook app, websites and in Instagram. 
        The topmost contributors on GitHub are employees of Facebook. Also React.org provides a set of blogs which gives the detailed explanation of each topic of react JS. </p>
    <h3>angular</h3>
        <p>
            Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Angular’s primary purpose is to develop single-page applications because of this feature it got spread widely all over the world. 
            Another main reason for the popularity of Angular is the Front-end Development. To gain attraction we should have web and mobile applications in a very attractive manner, this can be done using angular JS. Company websites like PayPal, Netflix, Google, Virgin America and many more are built using Angular. 
            Angular provides, databinding, MVC – Model View Controller design pattern, dependency injection and cross platform support. 
            Also, Angular is very easy to learn and implement. Since it is an open-source framework the affordability of angular is cost free. 
            Angular JS provides completely declarative UI expressions so, it can provide the structured and understandable components to manipulate.  </p>

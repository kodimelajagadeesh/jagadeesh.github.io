    <h3>SQL</h3>
    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is the standard language for interacting with databases, and it plays a crucial role in data management and retrieval. Here are some key theoretical concepts and principles associated with SQL <br>

        1. **Relational Databases**:<br>
           - SQL is designed for use with relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.<br>
        
        2. **Data Model**:<br>
           - SQL is based on the relational data model, which represents data as tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).<br>
        
        3. **Tables**:<br>
           - Tables are the fundamental structure in SQL. They store data in rows and columns. Each table represents a particular entity or concept.<br>
        
        4. **Data Types**:<br>
           - SQL supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, dates, and custom data types.<br>
        
        5. **CRUD Operations**:<br>
           - SQL provides four fundamental operations: Create (INSERT), Read (SELECT), Update (UPDATE), and Delete (DELETE). These operations allow you to manipulate data within tables.<br>
        
        6. **SQL Statements**:<br>
           - SQL consists of various statements, including SELECT (for querying data), INSERT (for adding data), UPDATE (for modifying data), DELETE (for removing data), and others like CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE.<br>
        
        7. **Queries**:<br>
           - SQL queries are used to retrieve specific data from a database. The SELECT statement is commonly used to build queries.<br>
        
        8. **Filtering and Sorting**:<br>
           - SQL allows you to filter and sort data using the WHERE clause for conditions and the ORDER BY clause for sorting.<br>
        
        9. **Joins**:<br>
           - SQL supports different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column.<br>
        
        10. **Aggregation**:<br>
            - SQL provides aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN) for summarizing and analyzing data.<br>
        
        11. **Grouping**:<br>
            - The GROUP BY clause is used to group data into subsets for performing aggregate functions on those subsets.<br>
        
        12. **Indexes**:<br>
            - Indexes are used to improve query performance by allowing the database system to locate data quickly.<br>
        
        13. **Transactions**:<br>
            - SQL supports transactions, which are sequences of one or more SQL statements that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure data integrity and consistency.<br>
        
        14. **Normalization**:<br>
            - Database normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves creating tables with appropriate relationships.<br>
        
        15. **Data Constraints**:<br>
            - SQL enables the use of constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL) to enforce data integrity rules.<br>
        
        16. **Views**:<br>
            - Views are virtual tables generated from the result of a SQL query. They provide a way to simplify complex queries and control data access.<br>
        
        17. **Stored Procedures and Functions**:<br>
            - SQL allows the creation of stored procedures and functions, which are sets of SQL statements that can be executed by calling the procedure or function.<br>
        
        18. **Security**:<br>
            - SQL databases provide security features to control access to data, such as user roles and permissions.<br>
        
        19. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**:<br>
            - DDL statements are used to define and manage the structure of the database, including creating tables, altering their structure, and deleting tables.<br>
        
        20. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**:<br>
            - DML statements are used to manipulate data in the database, including inserting, updating, and deleting records.<br>
        
        Understanding these theoretical concepts is fundamental for working with SQL and relational databases effectively. SQL is a critical skill for data professionals, software developers, and anyone involved in data management and analysis.</p>
